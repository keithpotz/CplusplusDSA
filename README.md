## Analysis
The over all problem is understand the runtime of different important data structures in Computer Science and what their uses  are in different applicaitons. I needed to understand what each data structure did in order to apporach these problems effectively. I made sure that I took the time each week of the course to understand what I was doing so that I could make better infomred decisions. Data structures are the foundation of Computer Science in general. It's important to understand them becuase they help to process data and different types of problems when applied effectively. Any roadblocks that I encountered in this class I used a few different resources. The book was a great resource as well as youtube and stackoverflow. These resources helped me to draw different conculsions but also helped me to understand how to implements the different types of data structures that were covered in the class. The work here has helped me to understand how to look at computational problems differently. Now I make considerations of different types of problems that I might encounter when creating algorithms for differnt types of problems. I am more aware of how my projects can function effectively and quicker. The work on these projects have allowed me to further modular coding but also make sure that I am keeping in mind the operational cost of that code. It's teaching me to think beyond not just well structured code but also well structured alogrithms.
